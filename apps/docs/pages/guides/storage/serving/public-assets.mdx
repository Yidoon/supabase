import Layout from '~/layouts/DefaultGuideLayout'

export const meta = {
  id: 'storage-serving-public-assets',
  title: 'Serving Public Assets',
  description: 'Learn how to serve Supabase Storage public assets.',
  sidebar_label: 'Serving',
}

As mentioned in the [Buckets Fundamentals](/guides/storage/buckets/fundamentals) all files uploaded in a public bucket are publicly accessible and benefit a high CDN cache HIT ratio.

You can access them by using this conventional URL:

```
https://[project_id].supabase.co/storage/v1/public/[bucket]/[asset-name]
```

You can also use the Supabase SDK `getPublicUrl` to generate this url for you

```js

const publicUrl = supabase.storage.from('bucket').getPublicUrl('filePath.jpg')

```

### Downloading
If you want the browser to start an automatic download of the asset instead of trying serving it, you can add the `?download` querystring parameter.

By default it will use the asset name to save the file on disk. You can optionally pass a custom name to the `download` parameter as following: `?download=customname.jpg`

export const Page = ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta} children={children} />

export default Page
