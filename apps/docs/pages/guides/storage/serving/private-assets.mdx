Assets stored in a non-public bucket are considered private and are not accessible via a Public url like the public buckets.
You can access them only by:

- Signing a time limited URL on the Server, for example with Edge Functions.
- with a GET request the url `https://[project_id].supabase.co/storage/v1/authenticated/[bucket]/[asset-name]` and the user Authorization header


### Signing URLs

You can sign a time-limited URL that you can share to your users by invoking the `createSignedUrl` method on the SDK.

```js
const {data, error} = supabase.storage.from('bucket').createSignedUrl('private-document.pdf', 3600)

if (data) {
    console.log(data.signedUrl)
}
```

### Access Control

If want your users to be able to fetch an asset from the url `https://[project_id].supabase.co/storage/v1/authenticated/[bucket]/[asset-name]` and provide granular RLS policies to determine the access, you will need grant the `SELECT` action to your RLS policy

#### Allowing individual access

Allow a user to access a file that was previously uploaded by the same user:

```sql
create policy "Individual user Access"
on storage.objects for select
to authenticated
using ( auth.uid() = owner_id );
```
