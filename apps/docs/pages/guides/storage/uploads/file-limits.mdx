You can customise the Max file size for file uploads.

## Global File Size
You can set the max file size across all your buckets by setting this global value in the Admin Studio.
You'll find this option in the Admin studio under **Settings > Storage > Max File Size**.

For Free projects it cannot exceed 50MB. On the Pro Plan and above, you can set this value to up to 5GB to allow file uploads larger than 50MB as illustrated in the table below.

| Plan   |      Max File Size
|----------|-------------|
| Free |  50MB |
| Pro |   5GB   |
| Team | 5GB |
| Enterprise | 5GB |

If you need more than 5GB please contact us.

Remember, this option is a global limit, which applies to all your buckets.
You can additionally specify the max file size on a per [bucket level](/guides/storage/buckets/creating-buckets#restricting-uploads) but it cannot be higher than this global limit.

It is a good practice to have the Global limit set to the highest possible file size that your application would accept, and always apply per bucket limits which can be lower.

## Per Bucket Restrictions

You can have different restrictions on a per bucket level.
You are able to restrict the file types such as: `pdf`,`images`,`videos` and the max file size which should be lower then the Global Limit.

To apply these limit on a bucket level see [Creating Bucket](/guides/storage/buckets/creating-buckets#restricting-uploads)
